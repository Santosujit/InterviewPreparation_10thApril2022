//		static methods can not be overwritten
//		static methods are stored inside common area allocation, not inside object
//		static method should be called by class name not by object name
//		Method Hiding
//		static methods can be overloaded
//		so main() method can be over loaded but main() method can't be overridden
//		static blocks will be executed before the main() method
//		we can compile and run a java program without using main() method, we have to use static block
